  //
  //  - crawl from a directory provided by argv[1] to produce and index
  //  - prompt the user for a query and read the query from stdin, in a loop
  //  - split a query into words (check out strtok_r)
  //  - process a query against the index and print out the results

  // When searchshell detects end-of-file on stdin (cntrl-D from the
  // keyboard), searchshell should free all dynamically allocated
  // memory and any other allocated resources and then exit.
